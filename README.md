# myfirstwebsite
my first complete website created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It is a E-commerce website designed for one of my curricular modules. 
The website has a kpop theme. The website is featured with a sliding montage of images in the center of the home page. 
The top of the website has anchor tags that lead you to various parts of the e-commerce website. 
The sign-in/sign-up section has animation that hides certain buttons depending on the intention of the user. 
The cart anchor tag is on the cart image. Clicking it will take you the cart where you checkout your chosen purchase.
